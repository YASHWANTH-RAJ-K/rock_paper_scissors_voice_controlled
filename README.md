# Rock - Paper - Scissors Mini Game - Voice Controlled
This is a python project that uses voice controlled input and output.
All of us have played Rock - Paper - Scissors at some point in our childhood right?
It uses Google's speech recognition and pyttsx3 module for voice related input and output.
This is a new version of the game that is fully voice controlled and requires a microphone to operate.

A few screenshots of the game in action!

If the app does not understand what the user is trying to speak, it will be handled by the suitable error message, otherwise it prints what the user speaks.

Stats are shown when the user quits the game by speaking "no" when prompted.
