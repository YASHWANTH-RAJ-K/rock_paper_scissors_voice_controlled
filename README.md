# Voice_controlled_rock_paper_scissors_python
This is my first python project that uses voice controlled input and output.
All of us have played Rock - Paper - Scissors at some point in our childhood right?
It uses Google's speech recognition and pyttsx3 module for voice related input and output.
This is a new version of the game that is fully voice controlled and requires a microphone to operate.
Thank You :)
Happy coding!
